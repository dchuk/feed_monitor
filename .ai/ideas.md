- Make sure that feed fetching is a separate action from item fetching when ran in background jobs (when manually ran in the admin, both feeds and items should be fetched in realtime)
- button rendering is not clean (could be fixed with better overall styling of components)
- need to show categories and tags on the item show view
- add delete button to source list view
- consolidate all logs into a single table/section, with filters for log types, times, sources, searching, etc
- for the sources interval heatmap, clicking any box should filter the table to those sources
- job queues table needs to be rethought
- add opml import/export
- remove new source link from navbar
- clean upgrade strategy
