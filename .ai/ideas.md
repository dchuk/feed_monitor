- job queues stats cards needs to be rethought
- add opml import/export
- clean upgrade strategy
- growl notifications are spamming the user when taking bulk actions
- add ability to manage per-source scraping rate limits to override configuration defaults
- ensure adaptive scheduling only reacts to truly new content (fetching a feed should use hashing on the summary or scrape to determine the item has really been updated, otherwise don't update anything)
